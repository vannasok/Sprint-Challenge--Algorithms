#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) the loop run based on n

b)O(nlogn) the outer loop run O(n), and the inner loop also run O(logn),

c) O(n) This recursive function only happens as many times as n is.

## Exercise II

- using binary search recursive method,
- time complexity: O(log n)

- start with the middle floor of the building, drop the egg, 1)if egg doesn't break, eliminate the floor below the middle of the building. 2) if egg breaks, eliminate the floor above the middle,
- repeat the step until the f floor is found.
